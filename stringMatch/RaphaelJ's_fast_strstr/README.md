Fast strstr()
=============

A fast substitution to the stdlib's `strstr()` sub-string search function.

`fast_strstr()` is significantly faster than most sub-string search algorithms
when searching relatively small sub-strings, such as words. We recommend any
user to benchmark the algorithm on their data as it uses the same interface as
`strstr()` before discarding other algorithms.

Its worst case complexity (`O(n × m)` where `n` is the length of the string and
`m` the length of the searched sub-string) is the same as the naive brute-force
algorithm but it mostly runs with a linear complexity (`O(n)`) on most strings.

Algorithm
---------

Unlike other efficient sub-string search algorithms, it doesn't try to skip
characters of the string but reads *every character* of the string.
However, the amount of work done for each character is substantially smaller.

This algorithm is thus faster when the searched sub-string has a small number of
characters as other algorithms are not able to skip a large number of
characters.

Its starts by computing the sum of the character values of the sub-string.

It then reads the string by shifting a reading window the size of the
sub-string. It knows the sum of the character values inside this window and is
able to update this sum when shifting it.

Comparing the two sub-string (the one inside the iterating window and the
searched one) only occurs when the both sums are equal (actually when sums
difference equals zero for performance issues). This trick enable the algorithm
to skip a large number of comparisons.

A reference implementation of the algorithm is freely available
[here](fast_strstr.c).

This algorithm is a special case of the
[Rabin-Karp algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin-Karp_algorithm) for
sub-string search which uses a simple sum as rolling hash function.

Benchmarks
----------

The algorithm has been benchmarked together with three other algorithms by
searching all occurrences of 100 random Latin words in portions of *Commentarii
de Bello Gallico* by *Julius Caesar*. Each test was run 100 times on an
*AMD Phenom II X4 965* and the best time was taken.

`strstr()` is from the *GNU C Library* (version 2.19) and uses the *Two Ways
Algorithm*, `naive strstr()` is a naive brute-force implementation and
`Volnitsky's strstr()` is
[an algorithm by Leonid Volnitsky](http://volnitsky.com/project/str_search/)
whereas `fast_strstr()` is our implementation.
Scores where compared to `strstr()`.

Section of 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000 characters of *Bello Gallico*
along with the full text (147277 characters) have been used.

Notice that as the algorithm doesn't require to pre-process the sub-string while
other algorithms such as Volnitsky's do, it is also fast on short strings.

Benchmarks were also tried by third parties on newer *Intel*'s *Haswell* and
*Sandy Bridge* processors, with less impressive results (`strstr()`
significantly defeated `fast_strstr()` when reading large texts).
We are working on what could give such poorer results. As said in the
introduction, we suggest you to try the algorithm on your data before discarding
`strstr()`.

Benchmark scripts are available [here](benchmark). These have been written in
*Haskell* and require the *Criterion* benchmarking library to run.

If you want to run the benchmarks on your hardware, download and install the
*Glasgow Haskell Compiler* and its library manager *Cabal*. Then go in the
[benchmark/](benchmark) directory and ask `cabal` to install the required
libraries :

```
cabal install --only-dependencies
```

Then compile the benchmark executable using `cabal build`. The resulting
executable should be located at `benchmark/dist/build/benchmark/benchmark`.
